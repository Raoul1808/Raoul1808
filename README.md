### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Raoul1808 (AKA Mew). I'm a French student, gamer and (almost completely) self-taught programmer.

I code in C++, C#, Python and Rust. I make:
- Games (game jams, personal projects)
- Mods (Terraria)
- Bots (Discord)
- and other random stuff (word lister, text converter)

I also have a little experience with Java and Lua, occasionally making mods for some other games/contributions to open-source projects.

I listen to an unhealthy amount of J-EDM please send help
