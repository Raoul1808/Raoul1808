### Hi there 👋
I'm Raoul1808 (AKA Mew). I'm a French student, gamer, weeb and programmer.

I code in C# and Python, I make:
- Games (game jams, personal projects)
- Mods (Spin Rhythm XD, Terraria)
- Bots (Discord)
- and other random stuff (word lister, text converter)

I also have a little experience with C++, Java and Lua, occasionally making mods for some other games/contributions to open-source projects.
